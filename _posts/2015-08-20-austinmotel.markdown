 The Austin Motelâ€™s land was purchased by German immigrants in 1888, and their children built the motel 50 years later to capitalize on the automobile boom. It has been in continuous operation [since 1938](http://www.austinmotel.com/history.html), and run by three generations of the Thompson family since [1961](http://www.cladriteradio.com/images/austinmotel1b.jpg). Their [rooms](http://www.austinmotel.com/roommap.html) are known for having their own unique theme, and the neon sign is the original one that was erected in the 30s.

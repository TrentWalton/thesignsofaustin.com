Built in [1878](http://looneylisting.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1614-Lavaca-St-78701.jpg) to be one of Austin’s first firehouses, [Buck Steiner](https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fstdp) bought the building in 1932 and turned it into Capitol Saddlery. Their boots were famously made by [Charlie Dunn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Dunn), who was immortalized in a [Jerry Jeff Walker song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fg3y_PvUxM) and known as the “Michelangelo of cowboy boots." Steiner’s grandson, Bobby, moved the business in 2007, and the building was later turned into a [residence](http://www.statesman.com/news/lifestyles/fashion-style/capitol-saddlery-first-firehouse-turns-venetian-pa/nRxHr/).

The welcoming yellow glow of The Hole In the Wall marquee has been a fixture on The Drag since 1974. With legendary venues such as [Liberty Lunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Lunch) and [Armadillo World Headquarters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armadillo_World_Headquarters) long gone, The Hole epitomizes the original spirit of Austin’s music scene. They were almost shut down for good in 2003, but were [saved](http://www.austin360.com/news/entertainment/music/hole-in-the-wall-finds-its-groove-again-2/nRzHW/) at the 11th hour by the owners of Austin’s Pizza.

The Magnolia Cafe story actually begins with Ken Carpenter and the [original Omelettry restaurant](http://multimedianewsroom.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_4336.jpg) on Burnet Road. Carpenter opened a second location of the Omelettry on Lake Austin Boulevard in 1979 with [Patricia and Kent Cole](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_DY_Y2BHKk3M/TUYwIF_dOzI/AAAAAAAAC7E/DXNPoysGcaE/s1600/PB190223.JPG). After the Colesâ€™ divorce a few years later, Patricia started Kerbey Lane in 1980, and Kent took over the operation of [Omelettry West](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/556f483ce4b037539dac6851/5570db22e4b0e2313ed9d017/5570dc86e4b0c9c67dd8600a/1433459846452/web+OmWest+Ads+1980+Chron+copy.jpg?format=2500w). Kent later renamed it the Magnolia Cafe and added a south location in 1988. Their sign on South Congress was a joint collaboration between local sign painter [Gary Martin](http://www.garymartinsigns.com/) and neon artist [Evan Voyles](http://theneonjungle.com/).

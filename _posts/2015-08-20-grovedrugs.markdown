The [Morley Brothers](http://www.peachridgeglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MorleyBrosHistoricalPlaque.jpg) founded their drugstore in 1874 and sold it to Vernon Grove in 1933. For decades the tall, brightly lit neon sign was a [6th street landmark](http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth33544/m1/1/?q=grove%20drugs). After 100 years in operation, the building was converted into the Austin Visitor and Information Center. While they’ve done their best to repurpose the original sign, it’s just a [shell of its former glory](http://cache.marriott.com/propertyimages/a/aussh/phototour/aussh_phototour85.jpg?Log=1).

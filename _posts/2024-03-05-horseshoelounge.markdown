Famous for its shuffleboard tournaments and jukebox, The Horseshoe Lounge was founded by Rene and Jimmy Gewing in 1965 after they took over the building’s lease from [American Legion Post 83](https://www.txlegion83.org/post-83). The Gewing’s daughter Tennia started running the bar with her husband Brad in 2004, but rising rent forced the Horseshoe to [close down in 2015](https://austin.eater.com/2014/12/31/7475909/iconic-south-lamar-dive-horseshoe-lounge-will-move-after-50-years) after 50 years in service. At the time, it was the oldest bar in South Austin. There [were plans to move](https://austin.eater.com/2015/2/23/8094481/the-horseshoe-lounges-iconic-sign-trucked-off-to-its-new-riverside) the bar and original sign to 153 E Riverside Drive and relaunch as Shoe.2, but permitting challenges at the new building prevented it from happening. The original location is now [The Golden Goose](https://www.thegooseaustin.com/) bar.

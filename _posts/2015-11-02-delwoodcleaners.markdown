The [Delwood neighborhood](http://www.cherrywoodinfo.com/cherrywood-history/the-story-of-cherrywood/) was founded in [1947](http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth33068/m1/1/?q=delwood) as affordable post-war housing. Delwood Cleaners opened its doors in the early 1980s as the Royal Touch Cleaners. It is down the street from the [first commercial](http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth18887/m1/1/?q=delwood) [shopping center](http://cherrywood.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Delwood-Center-2-ed.jpg) in Texas, where the [Fiesta](http://x.lnimg.com/photo/poster_768/b50b3dab80a54795af582a98afe56da7.jpg) now stands. Â Next door to the shopping center was the old Delwood Drive-In which was destroyed by a hurricane in 1961. Over the years the Delwood neighborhood [has been called](http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/1998-02-27/522901/) everything from Cherrywood to Maplewood to Wilshire Wood. Now with the Mueller development rapidly expanding, it is losing its identity even further.

An [Austin institution](http://downtownaustinblog.org/2010/02/04/what-happened-to-las-manitas/) for 26 years, Las Manitas was [opened](http://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/on-the-menu-las-manitas-avenue-cafe/) by sisters Lidia and Cynthia Perez after getting their start selling tacos on the Drag. The restaurant and several other local businesses were [controversially razed](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=13881484) in 2008 to make way for the second largest Marrriott hotel in the world. To address the criticism of losing a beloved local restaurant, Mr. J.W. Marriott was quoted as saying, “Why should you hold up a several-hundred-million-dollar investment because of a small little restaurant?”

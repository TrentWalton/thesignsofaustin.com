Warehouse Liquors exemplifies the old Austin spirit in the [Galindo neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galindo,_Austin,_Texas) of south Austin. Galindo is a small pocket of 4,000 residents in the 78704 area code bounded by Ben White, South First, Oltorf, and South Lamar. It’s known for cheap eateries, low-key dive bars and storefronts that have seen better days. Warehouse Liquors was opened in 1972 and is flanked by [G&S Lounge](http://gandslounge.com/), a pawn shop, laundromat, and Taqueria Arandas. It’s rare to find such an undisturbed piece of Austin so close to the center of town.

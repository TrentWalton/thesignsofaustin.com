In the early 1900s, [Sam Kruger](https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fkr08) began making watches in his native Ukraine. After immigrating to America in 1904, he started the Kruger Jewelry Company in Fort Worth. Along the way, he gave a job to his nephew [Morris Zale](https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fza11) and helped him open his [own store](https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/dhz01) in Wichita Falls. Kruger settled into his downtown Austin location in [1939](http://www.krugersjewelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/historySlide_6.jpg) which is currently run by his grandson David.

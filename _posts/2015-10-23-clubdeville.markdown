Known for the rock wall backdrop on their outdoor stage, Club de Ville fell victim to increasing downtown rents in 2013 and [never re-opened](http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/music/2013-10-12/club-de-ville-closes/) after 16 years in business. But it’s perhaps just as well known as [Chances](http://www.austinchronicle.com/features/1998-12-25/chances-are/), an eclectic lesbian club that occupied the same space from 1986-1994. [Cheer Up Charlie’s](http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/gay-place/2013-12-30/cheer-up-charlies-new-red-river-digs/) recently moved into the building from East 6th St, and shares a similar laid-back vibe. The Club de Ville sign, topped with an [old Best Western crown](https://www.flickr.com/photos/neatocoolville/3046901269/), was created by Evan Voyles of [The Neon Jungle](http://theneonjungle.com/).

Morin Scott [opened](http://www.continentalclub.com/Austin/photopageCCHistory.html) the Continental Club [in 1957](https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/xdc07) as a private supper club. In the late 1970s it was bought by the former owners of the [One-Knite club](http://www.michaelcorcoran.net/archives/3259), and the owners of [Liberty Lunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Lunch) briefly ran the club in the 1980s. Current owner Steve Wertheimer took over in [1987](http://www.austin360.com/news/entertainment/music/a-closing-set-that-still-reverberates-2/nRzhp/), having learned the ropes of the music business at the old [Rome Inn](http://www.thirdav.com/hd_discog/clubs/img_austin_studio29.html) (now Texas French Bread) on West Campus. Wertheimer recently [opened C-Boy’s Heart & Soul](http://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2014-01-31/to-c-boy-with-love/) in the former home of the long-time dive bar [Trophy’s](http://do512blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/TROPHYS.jpg) on South Congress. The Continental Club sign was restored by [Gary Martin](http://www.garymartinsigns.com/) and [Ben Livingston](http://www.beneon.com/).

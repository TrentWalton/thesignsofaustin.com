In 1938, Quality Seafood got it’s start as a stall in Starr’s Fruit and Vegetable Market across from the Capitol . The original owner was [Garnet Lenz](https://qualityseafood.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/img003.jpg), and he moved the business around until settling into a [storefront](https://qualityseafood.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/img001.jpg) on E MLK Blvd (then 19th Street). They were forced out by the University in 1970, and moved into a former bowling alley on Airport Blvd to capitalize on the opening of Highland Mall.

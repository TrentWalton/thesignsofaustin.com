The Martinez family has been serving some of Austin’s best Mexican food since 1952. [Matt Martinez](http://austin.culturemap.com/news/restaurants-bars/07-08-12-09-28-matts-el-rancho-turns-60-all-hail-the-king-of-mexican-food/) was a golden glove [boxer](http://boxrec.com/boxer/334007) that got his start in the restaurant business by selling his wife’s tamales from a pushcart in East Austin. They settled into their current location in 1986. Rumor has it that Matt’s was a favorite of President Johnson, and he would send Air Force 1 to fetch their famous chili relleno.

The Centennial Liquor Store on North Lamar is long gone, but its sign is resting peacefully in the parking lot of The Yellow Rose Cabaret. [Another sign](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Twin+Liquors/@30.2963332,-97.7422002,3a,75y,325.3h,90t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sAWtELAOLdOdUzR8ZjxYYNQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x8dc3e11250c761f5!6m1!1e1) survives at their original Guadalupe St location, although the store itself is now run by Twin Liquors. [Harry Joseph](http://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2013-10-04/lebanon-calling/), a Lebanese businessman, opened the original location in what would become a chain of 6 stores across the Austin area. However, the emergence of superstores such as Specâ€™s eventually put them out of business for good.

The [Yarborough](https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fyags) Branch of the Austin Public Library was originally the [Americana Theater](http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/6795), which was built in 1965 by [Trans-Texas Theaters](http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/aushc/00324/ahc-00324.html) owner Earl Podolnick. It was designed by local architect William B. Saunders and thrived as a single-screen theater throughout the 60s and 70s. It saw a steady decline in the 80s, was closed down in 1988, and purchased by the City of Austin in 1993 with plans of turning it into a library. Several temporary libraries had existed in the area, including a branch in the Allandale Shopping Center and the former [Atheist Center](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t6an2tdn-IQ/TtJPn3CVDfI/AAAAAAAAAgU/s3Tix5M2jOk/s400/aethistcenter.jpg) on Hancock Drive. The building and sign serve as a [model of adaptive reuse](http://midtexasmod.blogspot.com/2011/11/rebirth-of-americana-theatre-local.html).

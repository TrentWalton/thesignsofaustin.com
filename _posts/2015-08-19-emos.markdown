One of Austin’s most beloved music venues actually got it’s start in Houston, with the second location of Eric “Emo” Hartman’s club opening up in a former country & western bar on Red River St in 1992. The club mysteriously [shut down](http://pitchfork.com/news/44160-emos-austin-closing/) in 2011 and was [moved](http://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2013-02-15/music-news-the-pros-and-cons-of-hitchhiking/) to a location on Riverside Drive, which was the former home of the influential [Back Room](http://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2006-07-28/390520/). The Houston location has been closed down since 2001.

The Scottish Rite Theater is Austin’s oldest fully operation theater, erected by a German social organization in [1871](http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=25599). They used the building as an opera house until it was bought by the Scottish Rite Masons in [1914](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/21/Ben_Hur_Temple%2C_Austin%2C_Texas_%281912%29.jpg), who had been looking for a permanent home in Austin since 1881. For over a century the masons used the building as their private meeting hall, and in 2004 they launched the Scottish Rite Children’s Theater. Today the theater [hosts](http://scottishritetheater.org/) children’s plays, operas, circus acts, and the occasional concert.

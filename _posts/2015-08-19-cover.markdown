On the weekends, my wife and I used to walk up Barton Springs Road from our home as we made our way to South Congress. I started to admire the beautiful old signage that featured hand-cut lettering, exposed neon, and blinking bulbs amongst a sea of new construction. I started to photograph the signs for fun and decided one day to illustrate a few. As time went on, I started to notice the signs coming down and the stores going out of business. I realized that a new Austin was taking over and the charm of my once small city was disappearing. The sign project turned into a goal of 100 illustrations to document Austinâ€™s rich history.

Originally opened as Burkhart’s Motor Dining in 1964, Ray and Frances Stanish bought the restaurant in 1971 and re-opened it as Top Notch. They ran it for close to 40 years, only recently [selling it](http://www.austin360.com/news/lifestyles/food-cooking/for-new-owners-of-top-notch-change-isnt-on-the-m-1/nRshz/) in 2008. Although the fried chicken at Top Notch is hard to beat, it's probably most famous for being the setting of Richard Linklater’s 1993 film <i>[Dazed and Confused](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzEG81RV0uk)</i>.

The Texan Motel has been in a decades long battle with its neighbor, [Mehl’s Motel](https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4064/4686511303_81c9170ae7_b.jpg), for the most run-down accommodation in town. A night’s stay at the Texan will run you about 30 bucks, and it has been used as the “seedy motel” in a few [movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop-Loss_(film)). Their sign was put up around 1972, and there’s also a great [hand-painted billboard](https://www.flickr.com/photos/roadsidenut/5607786147/in/photolist-5Q3VAv-aqGgFy-74Dqif-5714gC-asGyEc-aqE3Me-bFcg1Z-wf1beV-6RQvTW-DWiZE-DWiYb-DWiXv-DWiZm-DWiZ4-DWiYy-iVM8Eu-9xxns4-sptfT1-6HrL2Z-938mcv-vX5uin-ebjd2d-dBEaQU-59VgEK-8A75bL-iXnzMe-dByKnc-4mLaT6-9JNNq3-evkLWK-7vPiKN-5S6Ft9-8uxYUn-8RJSXm-8HRSof-5yKNqg-dmk9B7-75hxRP-qwra1M-qwrcuz-qwr5Ap-7dkrNi-8HRT6Y-8HNFVn-8HNKnR-8HNHWc-8HRQx3-cDPaeE-66jT7G-48gTB6/) on the property that advertises 43 cable channels and air conditioning. The rapidly expanding development of Lamar Boulevard hasn’t quite caught up to this small strip, but it’s only a matter of time.

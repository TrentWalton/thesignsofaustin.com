In 1973, Hilbert and Lucille Maldono opened their first restaurant on North Lamar in a former [Burger Chef](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/230809549626466178/) (now a [P Terryâ€™s](http://www.roadarch.com/11/4/pterrys.jpg)). They went on to open additional locations on [Burnet Road](http://www.scrumptiouschef.com/food/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC07678.jpg) and West 35th in old mission-style Taco Bells. The West 35th location is famous for having a [Volkswagen towing a hamburger](https://cmga360dining.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/hillberts-09-1.jpg) on the roof. After many decades, their Cameron Road restaurant is the only one still in operation.
